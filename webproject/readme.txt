Äänestys- ja keskustelupalvelu is a web-project, which aim is to create a web service 
with a client-side and a server-side implementation. 
The service offers a site where users can send chat messages and vote on topics 
suggested by them.
The client-side implementation is done using a combination of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript 
which will consist of a dynamic website that can be used to communicate with the server-side.
The server-side implementation uses PHP to access a MySQL database 
which stores the chat logs, vote counts, vote topics and user information.
The two sides communicate through the use of REST API with JSON being the primary mode of exchanging files.
The client-side uses AJAX to contact the server-side.

This project was made as a part of the Web-projekti course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.
